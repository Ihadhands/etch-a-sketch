# etch-a-sketch

For this project I have created a small Etch-A-Sketch app <br>
The idea is that you start with a basic 16 x 16 grid and<br>
can use your mouse to fill in the empty spaces. There is <br>
options to create a bigger grid (up to 100), change colors, <br>
use an eraser to clear lines and clear to reset the grid entirely. <br>

Using a combination of javaScript and CSS grid, I was able <br>
to create a dynamic grid that allows for user input. <br>
This project was rather challenging at first, understanding <br>
how to format a css grid and ensure that the grid would clear <br>
before making a new one took a little while. <br>
I also re-worked my functions, more so to understand functions <br>
themselves.

This project was completed for The Odin Project.
